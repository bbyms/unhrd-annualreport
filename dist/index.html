		<!-- Foreword -->
		<section class="foreword" id="foreword">
	<div class="content">
	  <h1>Foreword</h1>
	  <p class="lead">Cyclone Idai in Mozambique, Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas, the crisis across the Sahel, and the earthquake in Albania; the protracted Ebola virus outbreak in DRC and the continuing crises in Yemen, South Sudan, Nigeria and Bangladesh. Every year-end, it is difficult to look back at the past twelve months and recount what we achieved by listing humanitarian crises, especially tragic when so many of these are the same as the year before. It still gives some solace to scroll through our figures and realize that UNHRD has again played an important role; we delivered life-saving aid and support equipment that kick-started responses or helped move them forward, and the UNHRD Field Team was deployed to provide direct support on the ground. </p>
		<div class="grid grid-2">

		  <div>
			<p>
				Responding to crises in these volatile environments and complex settings becomes more challenging each year. That is why it is our duty to constantly review and adapt our work to meet the increasing needs. Supporting humanitarian partners by enhancing logistics collaboration and coordination is what we have been doing for the past two decades since our establishment in 2000. This would not have been possible without the continuous engagement of our donors who generously embraced the growth and development of the UNHRD network. Their support is what allows us to uphold our mandate of storing humanitarian items at no cost. 
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Because that’s what UNHRD is all about – having prepositioned stocks ready to be delivered wherever and whenever they are needed. For 2019, we calculated that those organizations who used UNHRD’s storage services saved USD 5.63 million, as opposed to using the commercial sector. At the same time, our donors have also allowed us to expand our service enabling us to meet the different needs of our now 90 partners.   
			</p>
		  </div>
  
		  <div>
			<P>
				In 2019, UNHRD focused on improving tools to allow partners a greater visibility of their stocks and operations through the newly launched <a href="https://partners.unhrd.org/page/partner-portal" class="text-blue" target="_blank" >Partner Portal</a>, enabling greater transparency and accountability. In addition, innovative thinking at the UNHRD Lab has provided partners with tailored equipment, such as new cold chain storage solutions for specialized food and medicines for disease outbreak responses.  
			</p>
	
			<p>
				From our desks to the field, at UNHRD teamwork matters. Throughout 2019, in addition to deployments of the Field Team to support emergency operations, UNHRD staff were deployed to 11 countries to support logistics and training activities - you will read about a few of these missions here. This report also highlights capacity building activities in Kuala Lumpur and Brindisi, key logistics training centres in their respective regions. However, no single delivery could have been done without our colleagues dealing with important back-office functions. We are therefore once again highlighting some of our colleagues who, while behind the scenes, are at the core of our business.

	  <p class="lead">
		Preceded by severe flooding, Cyclone Idai made landfall in Mozambique on 15 March 2019. With hundreds of thousands of displaced people also in Malawi and Zimbabwe, it is considered as one of the most damaging tropical cyclones ever recorded in the South West Indian Ocean basin.  
	  </p>
	</div>

	<div class="content">

	  <p>
		When an emergency strikes, a collaborative effort is crucial. Supporting the response in the three countries affected by Cyclone Idai, UNHRD coordinated cargo consolidation and transport pooling for 20 partners over the next six months. Most of the aid dispatched was for emergency shelter, including 61,400 tarpaulins, 29,500 blankets, 28,000 solar lights, 13,500 mosquito nets, 8,000 mats, and 3,000 kitchen sets.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Five members of the UNHRD Field Team were deployed to Mozambique to install equipment and work with partners on the ground. More information on this mission is available in the section <a href="#fieldsupport" class="text-blue" >Field Team</a> below.

	  Such airlifts are made available at a moment’s notice and have afforded UNHRD the possibility to offer partners multiple free-to-user transport options for emergency operations. Over the past three years, 16 in-kind flights have been offered by IHC to UNHRD to transport partners’ cargo.

		The humanitarian crisis in Yemen remains one of the worst in the world. Nearly five years of conflict have pushed parts of the country to the brink of starvation, exacerbating needs in all sectors.  
	  </p>
	</div>

	<div class="content">

	  <p>
		To scale up humanitarian activities in Yemen and meet the increased needs, WFP and the World Health Organisation (WHO) signed a strategic partnership agreement in 2019. In line with this, UNHRD stored temperature-sensitive medical and laboratory kits in Dubai, and arranged transportation by sea and land for cholera and other medical kits from WHO’s hub in Dubai to its warehouses in Yemen.  
	  </p>

	  <p>
		UNHRD also managed the delivery of 608 mobile storage units (MSUs) to WFP Yemen, providing 183,000 m² of warehouse capacity. If installed side by side, these would make up 18 km of a two-lane highway.

		In July 2019, WHO declared the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The DRC shares its borders with nine countries, with regular cross-border movement increasing the risk of the virus spreading.

	  <p>
		In addition to supporting partners’ efforts in the fight against EVD in the country, UNHRD boosted WFP and WHO’s regional response plan in neighbouring Uganda by managing 25 consignments (equalling 147 MT) of stocks and deploying four staff members to Kampala to provide logistics support.

Confirming this longstanding partnership, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (MAECI), H.E. Luigi Di Maio, visited UNHRD’s original facilities in Brindisi in December, accompanying the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, in his first official visit to Italy.

      The UNHRD Field Team worked hand in hand with the UN Humanitarian Air

      distribute cargo; assess storage capacity; carry out warehouse management;
      and load and dispatch items for helicopter operations.

      The crew in Mozambique installed 17 MSUs across the country, creating
      5,400 m² of storage capacity available to the humanitarian community.
      Before leaving Mozambique, the team ensured that local staff were well

	  <h1>Global Partner Meeting </h1>

	  <p class="lead">Forty-one participants from 33 organizations, representing UN agencies, governments and NGOs, gathered on 23 and 24 October for the UNHRD Global Partner Meeting 2019 hosted in Copenhagen, Denmark by our colleagues in UNICEF. This annual meetup offered once again an important opportunity to get together with partners to follow up on the action points from 2018, review stock rotation strategies, evaluate key performance indicators and overall to find solutions for stronger emergency preparedness and response. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
		The meeting included a mixture of operational discussions to identify ways to overcome challenges and increase coordination among partners, and how to effectively utilize the newly launched <a href="https://partners.unhrd.org/page/partner-portal" target="_blank" class="text-blue">Partner Portal</a> and internal dashboards. A focus session featured a presentation by the UNHRD Lab on new projects and developments with specific attention to green, cold chain solutions for field operations.

	  <h1>Irish Aid’s Standby Partner in Accra </h1>

	  <p class="lead">
		From June to December 2019, Conor Fyans, an engineer specializing in renewable energy, was seconded from the Irish Aid Rapid Response Corps to UNHRD Accra. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
		As well as working on infrastructure projects, such as roofing and drainage improvements, Conor conducted a business case study for the installation of a grid-tied solar power system to support the hub’s switch to renewable energy, further reducing running costs and carbon footprint. Ultimately, this approach aims to provide better independence from the national grid.   
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Between 2008 and 2019, Irish Aid has deployed six staff to UNHRD Accra to cover different roles, such as a Project Manager, Engineer, Fleet Manager and Logistics Officer.

			Innovation is critical for UNHRD to provide new and green supply chain solutions to improve humanitarian operations and reduce their footprint. The UNHRD Lab has been working on a temperature-controlled solution to transport specialized food and medicines, maintaining the right temperature along the journey from the warehouse to the field. To complement these endeavours, the UNHRD Lab has also worked on efficient equipment to store temperature-sensitive items in field settings.    
		  </p>
	  <h2>New cold chain storage solutions   </h2>
	  <p>
		Since 2018, the UNHRD Lab has focused on improvements to cold chain storage solutions for field operations with a specific focus on health responses. In 2019, after completing the test phase of an inflatable refrigerated tent, the UNHRD Lab worked with the supplier to reduce costs and transport size and optimize power efficiency. This resulted in a light-weight solution that can be transported with standard pick-up trucks to be set up within a few hours in the field without expert technicians.

	</div>
	<p>
		In 2019, the UNHRD Lab also worked on new cold-chain equipment for field operations, such as an insulated reefer container with solar panels (‘Suntainer’), and a new semi-permanent storage kit, integrated with a solar power system, which has since been deployed to Uganda.
