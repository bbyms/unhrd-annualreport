          humanitarian community. Unfortunately, this trend has become somewhat of a default setting over the past few

		<!-- Foreword -->
		<section class="foreword" id="foreword">
	<div class="content">
	  <h1>Foreword</h1>
	  <p class="lead">In June UNHRD celebrated the 18th anniversary of its founding, marking the establishment of the
		first hub in Brindisi in 2000. In many countries around the world, turning 18 signifies a transition into
		adulthood; now more than ever we, as a Network, must hold ourselves accountable as a critical tool for
		emergency preparedness and response, and work even harder for our humanitarian partners so they can rely on us
		to meet more demanding challenges in ever more complex environments.</p>
		<div class="grid grid-2">

		  <div>
			<p>
			  This Year in Review provides an overview that demonstrates the support UNHRD provided to its partners
			  responding to crises all over the world. The figures in this report were collated using newly developed
			  automated reporting tools, which will soon be available to partners as part of our efforts to expand our
			  digital services (we look forward to giving our partners more control of their stocks, analytics and activity
			  reports in 2019 through a newly revamped website and online partner portal).
			</p>
	
			<p>
			  What cannot be so directly quantified is the work going on behind the scenes that makes every operation
			  possible. From the suppliers to the final destinations, UNHRD performs a number of important back-office
			  functions to deliver relief items and logistics equipment to those in the field. Therefore, we are dedicating
			  part of this report to recognize the work of staff who provide fundamental support in procurement, finance,
			  human resources and admin to keep the UNHRD mechanism running smoothly and efficiently.
			</p>

			<p>
			  These staff are crucial when deploying the UNHRD Rapid Response Team and other staff on temporary field
			  assignments to provide technical support to our colleagues in the field. 
			</p>
		  </div>
  
		  <div>
			<p>
				Throughout 2018, UNHRD staff were
				deployed to 15 countries; this report will highlight the experiences of colleagues who worked in the
				Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Chad and Uganda, as well as capacity building activities in Kuala
				Lumpur. 
			  Additionally, UNHRD organized, participated in or hosted a number of trainings and simulations to
			  build the logistics and response capacities of its partners.
			</p>
	
			<p>
			  As we try to keep up with new challenges and contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals, UNHRD continues
			  to develop its own innovation LAB. Hosted in the Brindisi hub, the LAB is a research and development unit that
			  engages in efforts to improve logistics support equipment and packaging solutions. Partnering with
			  humanitarian organizations, academia, private sector actors and other stakeholders, the LAB is committed to
			  help the humanitarian community find new ways to reduce the environmental impact of operations, including by
			  integrating green technologies, reducing waste, and reusing and upcycling packaging materials.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Once again, we would like to sincerely thank our donors for their generous support, and our partners and
			  colleagues for their great teamwork. Your efforts and collaboration are what allow UNHRD to assist our 88
			  humanitarian partners provide lifesaving support to those in need.
			</p>

	  <h1>UNHRD LAB</h1>

	  <p class="lead">
		Working on challenges identified in the field by humanitarian organizations, the UNHRD LAB collaborates with
		universities and suppliers to research and develop innovative solutions for the supply chain in emergency
		response. Improving logistics support equipment, reducing waste from relief items and implementing new and
		green technologies are the main innovation efforts of the UNHRD LAB to address these challenges.

	  <h2>GREEN TECHNOLOGIES</h2>
	  <p>
		Helping humanitarian organizations reduce the environmental impact of their operations is one of the
		primary focus areas of research for the UNHRD LAB. These efforts help integrating the environment into
		emergency response, contributing to filling the gap between humanitarian intervention and sustainable
		development, in line with the holistic approach of the Agenda 2030.

		<h2>INTEGRATING GREEN TECHNOLOGIES</h2>
		<p>
		  The prefabricated storage tent, commonly known as mobile storage unit (MSU), is a multipurpose fundamental
		  piece of emergency logistics equipment. Given its wide use, the UNHRD LAB has engaged in researching and
		  developing solutions to further improve its efficiency and sustainability, including by integrating
		  solar, wind and hybrid power solutions.

	  <div class="call-out">
		<h2>INFLATABLE REFRIGERATED TENT</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes, new solutions are already available on the market but may not be specifically developed for humanitarian purposes. This is the case, for example, of inflatable refrigerated tents where the UNHRD LAB has suggested the implementation of solar panels and is testing its suitability to fields settings. This activity builds on one of the very first projects of the UNHRD Lab, the Temperature Controlled Unit (TCU), and is part of a research and development series to keep foods and medicine in the field.

		<h2>REPACKAGING</h2>
		<p>
		  Upon realizing that 10% of what is delivered to humanitarian contexts turn into waste, the UNHRD LAB has
		  engaged in efforts to improve packaging, including by reusing it or giving it a second life. New solutions
		  under development would benefit the beneficiaries, who would receive more efficient relief items, and the
		  environment, especially in terms of what is left behind from humanitarian operations.

		<h2>SOLAR KITCHEN SET</h2>
		<p>
		  In poor or disaster areas, energy sources can be costly, scarce and unreliable and also
		  very harmful to the environment. Wood fuel in most cases requires a cumbersome collecting process. As the
		  kitchen set is one of the most delivered relief items, the UNHRD LAB is redesigning its packaging to be
		  easily turned into a solar cooker. This solution is easy-to-set-up as it requires no more than three steps
		  to set up the solar cooker in less than a minute. It is also environment-friendly as it reduces waste and
		  consumption and the effects of fossil fuels.

		<h2>CRADLE TENT</h2>
		<p>
		  Family tents are shipped in large wooden crates that most of the time become waste or wood fuel, both having
		  an environmental impact. As these tents are often used by families with small children, but they don’t come
		  with accessories for babies, the UNHRD LAB has redesigned the crate
		  to be used as a cradle for small children from 0 to 4 months. With a key support from the suppliers, who
		  would have to modify the proportion of the crate and include some tools, this project would add a new and
		  innovative relief item to UNHRD’s catalogue, in addition to the standard family tent.
