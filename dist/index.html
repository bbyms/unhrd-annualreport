		<!-- Foreword -->
		<section class="foreword" id="foreword">
	<div class="content">
	  <h1>Foreword</h1>
	  <p class="lead">The novel coronavirus outbreak, which began in December of 2019, quickly expanded around the globe in early 2020 and, on 11 March, COVID-19 was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a pandemic. 
		
		  </p>
		  <p class="lead">
			The biggest global crisis since World War II, the COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly changed our operational environment and personal lives, pushing us beyond what anyone could have imagined. During this unprecedented emergency, UNHRD tripled its response efforts over the span of a year, supporting the global health and humanitarian response to COVID-19 and existing humanitarian responses around the world. 
			  </p>
		  <div class="grid grid-2">

		  <div>
			<p>
				This report highlights the three operational streams UNHRD was engaged in throughout 2020. In addition to providing core services for sudden-onset emergencies and protracted and complex crises, UNHRD supported partners in their response efforts amidst the pandemic and contributed to WFP’s comprehensive platform of free-to-user cargo transport services established for the COVID-19 global response.
			<p>	This platform for the humanitarian community was built on the existing UNHRD Network, where each hub was already a crucial element of the response effort in respective regions and with Brindisi serving as a global support. UNHRD hubs also provided supplementary support including procurement, transport, handling, customs clearance, and customer service were also used as delivery routes to move crucial items to the final countries of destination.      

			<p> Behind these efforts, there is a unique team of dedicated staff who once again confirmed their commitment to serve the humanitarian community and adapt to new demands. The entire UNHRD team went above and beyond the call of duty to better support partners as new and challenging needs arose during the past year, and five of them share their stories about how COVID-19 has impacted their lives in the body of this Year in Review. 
			</p>

			<p> While 2020 was dominated by COVID-19, it also marked important occasions. On June 20, 2000 an Ilyushin 76 took off from Brindisi with 36 mt of emergency aid and a mobile hospital destined for Asmara on behalf of the Italian Cooperation, to assist Eritreans caught in the border war with Ethiopia. 
			</p>

		</div>
  
		  <div>
			<P>
				That was the very first humanitarian flight managed by UNHRD which had become fully operational at the beginning of that month. Twenty years later, as travel and physical distancing restrictions made it impossible to hold official celebrations, we shared through our digital channels the stories of the pioneering staff and celebrated the forward-looking idea behind the establishment of UNHRD and its growth into a crucial resource for the humanitarian community.
			</p>
	
			<p>
				As part of WFP Supply Chain, UNHRD was also honored to celebrate the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to our organization for its efforts to combat hunger, its contribution to bettering conditions for peace in conflict-affected areas and for acting as a driving force in efforts to prevent the use of hunger as a weapon of war.  
			</p>

			<p>
				What we are now, and what we have achieved over the past 20 years would not have been possible without the generous engagement of our donors. That vision turned into a global model for emergency preparedness and response, a model which was further replicated by WFP to support the global COVID-19 response. UNHRD has never lived on past glories and has continuously grown from and adapted to changing operational environments. Now more than ever, as the world has irreversibly changed, we are committed to continue strengthening our mechanism, augmenting its agility and flexibility, and establishing new partnerships to develop innovative, sustainable solutions to respond to emergencies. The support of our donors remains essential in this venture, and we are thankful that we can continue to count on these important relationships.

		The COVID-19 outbreak, which began in December 2019, rapidly spread around the world, leading to widespread movement restrictions as governments scrambled to protect their citizens and disrupting supply chains, impacting both existing humanitarian operations and the global response to the pandemic.   
	  </p>

	<div class="content">

	  <p>
		In order to support the health and humanitarian response, WFP stepped up to offer its logistics expertise and infrastructure to establish a comprehensive platform of services to move cargo around the globe. Through the Global Humanitarian Response Plan, WFP provided these transport services at no cost to the humanitarian community.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
		UNHRD was the foundation of this platform of services. WFP built on this existing network, scaling up the already crucial support UNHRD was playing in the early stages of the response, and augmented its capacity by establishing global humanitarian hubs in an additional three strategic locations in Guangzhou, China, Johannesburg in South Africa and Liege, Belgium.   
	  </p>
	  <p>
		UNHRD hubs were used to move crucial items to the final country of destination, and provided additional support to WFP’s response including procurement, transport, handling, customs clearance, and customer service.

		On 4 August 2020, a massive explosion at the Port of Beirut, Lebanon devastated part of the city causing over 200 deaths, 6,500 injuries and leaving an estimated 300,000 people homeless.  
	  </p>
	</div>

	<div class="content">

	  <p>
		Within 24 hours, upon request of the Italian Cooperation, the team at UNHRD Brindisi prepared 8.5 mt of emergency health  supplies and trauma and surgical kits for urgent dispatch to Beirut, with items arriving within 48 hours of the blast.   
	  </p>

	  <p>
		In the following three days, the Brindisi hub managed three air rotations to deliver 18 mobile storage units (MSU)     along with generators and support tools as part of WFP’s  logistics support to the Government of Lebanon.    
	  </p>

	  <p>
		In the three months following the explosion, the Network managed a total of 13 shipments to Lebanon on behalf of six partners, delivering a total of 113 mt of relief items for the Italian Cooperation, the Australian Government , Cascos Blancos and the World Health Organization, as well as tools and equipment for the United Nations Development Programme.

	  <h1>Irish Aid’s Standby Partner in Accra </h1>

	  <p class="lead">
		From June to December 2019, Conor Fyans, an engineer specializing in renewable energy, was seconded from the Irish Aid Rapid Response Corps to UNHRD Accra. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
		As well as working on infrastructure projects, such as roofing and drainage improvements, Conor conducted a business case study for the installation of a grid-tied solar power system to support the hub’s switch to renewable energy, further reducing running costs and carbon footprint. Ultimately, this approach aims to provide better independence from the national grid.   
	  </p>

		Between 2008 and 2019, Irish Aid has deployed six staff to UNHRD Accra to cover different roles, such as a Project Manager, Engineer, Fleet Manager and Logistics Officer.

		Since taking over the chairmanship of the Group of Friends of UNHRD from Italy in 2018, <strong>Spain</strong> has engaged in efforts to raise awareness on the added value of UNHRD within the global humanitarian landscape. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
		In October 2019, the Permanent Representative of Spain to the UN-agencies in Rome held, in collaboration with Italy, a brown bag lunch at the WFP Headquarters in Rome to illustrate UNHRD’s activities and discuss challenges and potential opportunities. The event was an opportunity to reflect, together with WFP member state delegates, on how to enhance the UNHRD network and its partners’ potential to deliver assistance more efficiently and effectively.

			At this moment in time, there are almost 13,000 family tents stocked in UNHRD warehouses across the Network. They are one of the most common relief items used by UNHRD partners to assist populations in conflict, refugees and post-disaster crises.
		  </p>

	  <p>
		With babies and newborns among the most vulnerable in these crises, and with limited relief items specifically designed for their wellbeing, the UNHRD Lab, with its suppliers, developed the “Cradle Tent” which, once the geodesic tent is taken and installed, allows for the wooden crate to be modified into a crib with rockers, a baby mattress and sheets. This newly developed relief item also includes a blanket, a pillow with accompanying cover, a changing mat and a mosquito net. There are also complementary pieces such as a teddy bear, produced with excess materials from the production of blankets, a blackboard on the internal side of the crate’s lid, with white chalk and an eraser, and a picture book. 
	  </p>
	  <p> “Cradle Tent” is a great example of UNHRD Lab’s cross-sectoral efforts in waste reduction, and using repackaging to create a circular economy. 
	</p>
	<p>The item is now available to UNHRD partners for procurement and stockpiling.</p>

				2020 was the most challenging period since I joined UNHRD. While we were working hard to support the humanitarian community during the pandemic, we were ourselves in the midst of the same emergency. From one moment to the next we began working from home, and the workload increased hugely. It took some time to adapt and adjust to the new work dynamic, including balancing a professional and private life now both happening in the same place, my home. I did find this new balance, adapting to remote work and appreciating its advantages, and then I found out that the most beautiful experience of my life had just started and that a new little life was growing within my body, and Giuseppe then became my precious Christmas gift.

In the meanwhile, we handled meetings, airport operations, cargo preparation and dispatches, in addition to establishing new cargo handling and monitoring systems. It was a challenge, but with the support of the team we managed it. There is nothing more rewarding than knowing that you gave 100 percent plus a couple of cents for an operation.

				In the past I have supported and coordinated emergency shipments to various big crises, like Japan in 2011, Philippines in 2013, Nepal in 2015 and the current response in Bangladesh, but 2020 was an extremely challenging year. This was the one with the highest dispatch volume for the Kuala Lumpur hub, as we also contributed to the WFP Global Common Services, which had our teams working tirelessly to ensure rapid dispatches. Quick decisionmaking and prompt follow-ups were key. Working from home with limited breaks, I often worked late into the night coordinating dispatches and establishing transport contracts, ensuring cargo was booked on the earliest available flights to fulfil partner needs and requirements. For three months I was Officer in Charge, my role when the hub manager is away, adding new responsibilities during this trying period.  I contributed to finalizing and establishing the contracting for the new China hub, which was done efficiently in a remarkably short time. That was an achievement I’m proud to have been a part of!

				Every part of the process is vital to the running of a hub, and I’ve always enjoyed working on implementing systems at the Dubai hub such as barcoding, which help ensure accurate inventory and in turn support decisionmaking and timely planning of operations in humanitarian emergencies. During this pandemic crisis, continuing to run a successful operation, ensuring the safety of colleagues and high-risk families, and having myself battled COVID-19 were the challenges that were met. We’ve strictly implemented COVID-19 prevention protocols including running operations with minimum staff on rotation, physical distancing, restricting access to the warehouses and regularly sanitizing facilities. In this way, we’ve ensured continuity and adaptation to the new normal.

				The Las Palmas hub is located within the port area, so there were no restrictions to the operations during the lockdown period as port operations were considered essential. The adaptation to the prevention measures was easy as our suppliers were well aware of the risks of an outbreak and there was close cooperation to avoid contagion and, fortunately, we have not suffered any cases of COVID-19 among WFP staff or the employees of our contractors. 

From my personal point of view, similar to many other WFP colleagues I have been in contact with, it was not easy to deal with lockdown living alone but the hardest part was not to be able to see my family for six months. Also, it was sad not to be able to be close to the friends that lost relatives as the restrictions banned wakes and funerals.
