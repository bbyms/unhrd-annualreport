		<!-- Foreword -->
		<section class="foreword" id="foreword">
	<div class="content">
	  <h1>Foreword</h1>
	  <p class="lead">Cyclone Idai in Mozambique, Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas, the crisis across the Sahel, and the earthquake in Albania; the protracted Ebola virus outbreak in DRC and the continuing crises in Yemen, South Sudan, Nigeria and Bangladesh. Every year-end, it is sad to look back at the past twelve months and recount what we achieved by listing humanitarian crises; it is especially tragic when so many of these are the same as the year before. It still gives some solace to scroll through our figures and realize that UNHRD has again played an important role; we delivered life-saving aid and support equipment that kick-started responses or helped move them forward, and the UNHRD Field Team was deployed to provide direct support on the ground. </p>
		<div class="grid grid-2">

		  <div>
			<p>
				Responding to crises in these volatile environments and complex settings becomes more challenging each year. That is why it is our duty to constantly review and adapt our work to meet the increasing needs. Supporting humanitarian partners by enhancing logistics collaboration and coordination is what we have been doing for the past two decades since our establishment in 2000. This would not have been possible without the continuous engagement of our donors who generously embraced the growth and development of the UNHRD network. Their support is what allows us to uphold our mandate of storing humanitarian items at no cost. 
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Because that’s what UNHRD is all about – having prepositioned stocks ready to be delivered wherever and whenever they are needed. For 2019, we calculated that those organizations who used UNHRD’s storage services saved USD 5.63 million, as opposed to using the commercial sector. At the same time, our donors have also allowed us to expand our service enabling us to meet the different needs of our now 90 partners.   
			</p>
		  </div>
  
		  <div>
			<P>
				In 2019, UNHRD focused on improving tools to allow partners a greater visibility of their stocks and operations through the newly launched <a href="https://partners.unhrd.org/page/partner-portal" class="text-blue">Partner Portal</a>, enabling greater transparency and accountability. In addition, innovative thinking at the UNHRD Lab has provided partners with tailored equipment, such as new cold chain storage solutions for specialized food and medicines for disease outbreak responses.  
			</p>
	
			<p>
				From our desks to the field, at UNHRD teamwork matters. Throughout 2019, in addition to deployments of the Field Team to support emergency operations, UNHRD staff were deployed to 11 countries to support for logistics and training activities - you will read about a few of these missions here. This report also highlights capacity building activities in Kuala Lumpur and Brindisi, key logistics training centres in their respective regions. However, no single delivery could have been done without our colleagues dealing with important back-office functions. We are therefore once again highlighting some of our colleagues who, while behind the scenes, are at the core of our business.

        <p>With new crises occurring and protracted crises increasing, 2018 was another challenging year for the
          humanitarian community. Unfortunately, this trend has become somewhat of a default setting over the past few
          years and we as humanitarians have had to adjust our own ways of working to ensure aid is delivered and
          national capacities to cope are strengthened. </p>

	  <p class="lead">
		Preceded by severe deadly flooding, Cyclone Idai made landfall in Mozambique on 15 March 2019. With hundreds of thousands of displaced people also in Malawi and Zimbabwe, it is considered as one of the most damaging tropical cyclones ever recorded in the South West Indian Ocean basin.  
	  </p>
	</div>

	<div class="content">

	  <p>
		When an emergency strikes, a collaborative effort is crucial. Supporting the response in the three countries affected by Cyclone Idai, UNHRD coordinated cargo consolidation and transport pooling for 20 partners over the next six months. Most of the aid dispatched was for emergency shelter, including 61,400 tarpaulins, 29,500 blankets, 28,000 solar lights, 13,500 mosquito nets, 8000 mats, and 3,000 kitchen sets.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Five members of the UNHRD Field Team were deployed to Mozambique to install equipment and work with partners on the ground. More information on this mission is available in the section TEAMS IN THE FIELD below

			His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, generously donated four airlifts through the International Humanitarian City (IHC) at the onset of Cyclone Idai response.  

		Such airlifts are made available at a moment’s notice and have afforded UNHRD the possibility to offer partners multiple free-to-user transport options for emergency operations. Over the past three years, 16 in-kind flights have been offered by IHC to UNHRD to transport partners’ cargo.

	<div class="content">

	  <p>
		To scale up humanitarian activities in Yemen and meet the increased needs, WFP and the World Health Organisation (WHO) signed a strategic partnership agreement in 2019. In line with this, UNHRD stored temperature-sensitive medical and laboratory kits in Dubai, and arranged transportation by sea and land for cholera and other medical kits from WHO’s hub in Dubai to its warehouses in Yemen.  
	  </p>

	  <p>
		UNHRD also managed the delivery of 608 mobile storage units (MSUs) to WFP Yemen, expanding warehouse capacity by 183,000 m². If installed side by side, these would make up 18 km of a two-lane highway.

		In July 2019, WHO declared the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The DRC shares its borders with nine countries, with regular cross-border movement increasing the risk of the virus spreading.

		In addition to supporting partners’ efforts in the fight against EVD in the country, UNHRD boosted WFP and WHO’s regional response plan in neighbouring Uganda by managing 25 consignments (equalling 147 MT) of stocks and deploying four staff members to Kampala to provide logistics support.

			Since the establishment of UNHRD in 2000, Italy has been providing the premises of the Brindisi hub, funding its expansion and covering all running costs. Italy is not only a longstanding donor, but also a key partner since the Italian Cooperation relies on UNHRD’s services for stock prepositioning and emergency operations. Confirming this longstanding partnership, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (MAECI), H.E. Luigi Di Maio, visited UNHRD’s original facilities in Brindisi in December, accompanying the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, in his first official visit to Italy. In February, UNHRD and the WFP Director of Supply Chain, Jakob Kern, also welcomed the visit of Vice Minister of MAECI, Ms. Emanuela Del Re. In April, the Italian Cooperation donated 40 MT of medicines, shelter and WASH items to Iran valued at USD 321,000 to assist at least 11,000 people affected by the flash flooding.

Over the years, Irish Aid has also deployed six staff to UNHRD Accra working on the hub optimization and green technology projects – more information on the latest standby-partner’s mission is available in the Partnership section (hyperlink). In the response to Ethiopia, Irish Aid donated 51 MT of relief items to NGO partner Concern, including 5,475 blankets, 1,100 jerry cans, 6,100 mosquito nets, 2,800 tarpaulins, 2,000 hygiene kits, 3,153 kitchen sets and shelter toolkits.

		In a ceremony on 18 June at the annual session of the Executive Board of the World Food Programme, the Italian
		Government handed over the chairmanship of the ‘Group of Friends of UNHRD’ to the Spanish Government. Also
		promoted by the Government of Panama, the event was the opportunity to celebrate the 18th anniversary of
		UNHRD, which was first established in Brindisi, Italy in June 2000.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Launched in 2015 by the Italian Government, the Group of Friends of UNHRD brings together donors, partners and
		other actors who aim to raise awareness on the role of UNHRD in the global humanitarian architecture and who
		recognize the need to invest in emergency preparedness and response to ensure a sustainable UNHRD Network.
		Taking over the chairmanship, Ambassador Jesús Manuel García Aldaz, Permanent Representative of Spain to the
		UN in Rome, emphasized that “the spirit of the Agenda 2030 requires innovation and the establishment of
		transformative partnerships, including with the private sector and universities.”

	  <p class="lead">
		Working on challenges identified in the field by humanitarian organizations, the UNHRD LAB collaborates with
		universities and suppliers to research and develop innovative solutions for the supply chain in emergency
		response. Improving logistics support equipment, reducing waste from relief items and implementing new and
		green technologies are the main innovation efforts of the UNHRD LAB to address these challenges.

	  <h2>GREEN TECHNOLOGIES</h2>
	  <p>
		Helping humanitarian organizations reduce the environmental impact of their operations is one of the
		primary focus areas of research for the UNHRD LAB. These efforts help integrating the environment into
		emergency response, contributing to filling the gap between humanitarian intervention and sustainable
		development, in line with the holistic approach of the Agenda 2030.

		<h2>INTEGRATING GREEN TECHNOLOGIES</h2>
		<p>
		  The prefabricated storage tent, commonly known as mobile storage unit (MSU), is a multipurpose fundamental
		  piece of emergency logistics equipment. Given its wide use, the UNHRD LAB has engaged in researching and
		  developing solutions to further improve its efficiency and sustainability, including by integrating

		  Sometimes, new solutions are already available on the market but may not be specifically developed for humanitarian purposes. This is the case, for example, of inflatable refrigerated tents where the UNHRD LAB has suggested the implementation of solar panels and is testing its suitability to fields settings. This activity builds on one of the very first projects of the UNHRD Lab, the Temperature Controlled Unit (TCU), and is part of a research and development series to keep foods and medicine in the field.

		<h2>REPACKAGING</h2>
		<p>
		  Upon realizing that 10% of what is delivered to humanitarian contexts turn into waste, the UNHRD LAB has
		  engaged in efforts to improve packaging, including by reusing it or giving it a second life. New solutions
		  under development would benefit the beneficiaries, who would receive more efficient relief items, and the
		  environment, especially in terms of what is left behind from humanitarian operations.

		<h2>SOLAR KITCHEN SET</h2>
		<p>
		  In poor or disaster areas, energy sources can be costly, scarce and unreliable and also
		  very harmful to the environment. Wood fuel in most cases requires a cumbersome collecting process. As the
		  kitchen set is one of the most delivered relief items, the UNHRD LAB is redesigning its packaging to be
		  easily turned into a solar cooker. This solution is easy-to-set-up as it requires no more than three steps
		  to set up the solar cooker in less than a minute. It is also environment-friendly as it reduces waste and
		  consumption and the effects of fossil fuels.

		<h2>CRADLE TENT</h2>
		<p>
		  Family tents are shipped in large wooden crates that most of the time become waste or wood fuel, both having
		  an environmental impact. As these tents are often used by families with small children, but they don’t come
		  with accessories for babies, the UNHRD LAB has redesigned the crate
		  to be used as a cradle for small children from 0 to 4 months. With a key support from the suppliers, who
		  would have to modify the proportion of the crate and include some tools, this project would add a new and
		  innovative relief item to UNHRD’s catalogue, in addition to the standard family tent.
