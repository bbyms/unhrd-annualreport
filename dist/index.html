		<!-- Foreword -->
		<section class="foreword" id="foreword">
	<div class="content">
	  <h1>Foreword</h1>
	  <p class="lead">Cyclone Idai in Mozambique, Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas, the crisis across the Sahel, and the earthquake in Albania; the protracted Ebola virus outbreak in DRC and the continuing crises in Yemen, South Sudan, Nigeria and Bangladesh. Every year-end, it is sad to look back at the past twelve months and recount what we achieved by listing humanitarian crises; it is especially tragic when so many of these are the same as the year before. It still gives some solace to scroll through our figures and realize that UNHRD has again played an important role; we delivered life-saving aid and support equipment that kick-started responses or helped move them forward, and the UNHRD Field Team was deployed to provide direct support on the ground. </p>
		<div class="grid grid-2">

		  <div>
			<p>
				Responding to crises in these volatile environments and complex settings becomes more challenging each year. That is why it is our duty to constantly review and adapt our work to meet the increasing needs. Supporting humanitarian partners by enhancing logistics collaboration and coordination is what we have been doing for the past two decades since our establishment in 2000. This would not have been possible without the continuous engagement of our donors who generously embraced the growth and development of the UNHRD network. Their support is what allows us to uphold our mandate of storing humanitarian items at no cost. 
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Because that’s what UNHRD is all about – having prepositioned stocks ready to be delivered wherever and whenever they are needed. For 2019, we calculated that those organizations who used UNHRD’s storage services saved USD 5.63 million, as opposed to using the commercial sector. At the same time, our donors have also allowed us to expand our service enabling us to meet the different needs of our now 90 partners.   
			</p>
		  </div>
  
		  <div>
			<P>
				In 2019, UNHRD focused on improving tools to allow partners a greater visibility of their stocks and operations through the newly launched <a href="https://partners.unhrd.org/page/partner-portal" class="text-blue">Partner Portal</a>, enabling greater transparency and accountability. In addition, innovative thinking at the UNHRD Lab has provided partners with tailored equipment, such as new cold chain storage solutions for specialized food and medicines for disease outbreak responses.  
			</p>
	
			<p>
				From our desks to the field, at UNHRD teamwork matters. Throughout 2019, in addition to deployments of the Field Team to support emergency operations, UNHRD staff were deployed to 11 countries to support for logistics and training activities - you will read about a few of these missions here. This report also highlights capacity building activities in Kuala Lumpur and Brindisi, key logistics training centres in their respective regions. However, no single delivery could have been done without our colleagues dealing with important back-office functions. We are therefore once again highlighting some of our colleagues who, while behind the scenes, are at the core of our business.

        <p>With new crises occurring and protracted crises increasing, 2018 was another challenging year for the
          humanitarian community. Unfortunately, this trend has become somewhat of a default setting over the past few
          years and we as humanitarians have had to adjust our own ways of working to ensure aid is delivered and
          national capacities to cope are strengthened. </p>

	  <p class="lead">
		Preceded by severe deadly flooding, Cyclone Idai made landfall in Mozambique on 15 March 2019. With hundreds of thousands of displaced people also in Malawi and Zimbabwe, it is considered as one of the most damaging tropical cyclones ever recorded in the South West Indian Ocean basin.  
	  </p>
	</div>

	<div class="content">

	  <p>
		When an emergency strikes, a collaborative effort is crucial. Supporting the response in the three countries affected by Cyclone Idai, UNHRD coordinated cargo consolidation and transport pooling for 20 partners over the next six months. Most of the aid dispatched was for emergency shelter, including 61,400 tarpaulins, 29,500 blankets, 28,000 solar lights, 13,500 mosquito nets, 8000 mats, and 3,000 kitchen sets.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Five members of the UNHRD Field Team were deployed to Mozambique to install equipment and work with partners on the ground. More information on this mission is available in the section TEAMS IN THE FIELD below

		  His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, generously donated four airlifts through the International Humanitarian City (IHC) at the onset of Cyclone Idai response.  

	  Such airlifts are made available at a moment’s notice and have afforded UNHRD the possibility to offer partners multiple free-to-user transport options for emergency operations. Over the past three years, 16 in-kind flights have been offered by IHC to UNHRD to transport partners’ cargo.

		The humanitarian crisis in Yemen remains one of the worst in the world. Nearly five years of conflict have pushed parts of the country to the brink of starvation, exacerbating needs in all sectors.  
	  </p>
	</div>

	<div class="content">

	  <p>
		To scale up humanitarian activities in Yemen and meet the increased needs, WFP and the World Health Organisation (WHO) signed a strategic partnership agreement in 2019. In line with this, UNHRD stored temperature-sensitive medical and laboratory kits in Dubai, and arranged transportation by sea and land for cholera and other medical kits from WHO’s hub in Dubai to its warehouses in Yemen.  
	  </p>

	  <p>
		UNHRD also managed the delivery of 608 mobile storage units (MSUs) to WFP Yemen, expanding warehouse capacity by 183,000 m². If installed side by side, these would make up 18 km of a two-lane highway.

		In July 2019, WHO declared the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The DRC shares its borders with nine countries, with regular cross-border movement increasing the risk of the virus spreading.

	  <p>
		In addition to supporting partners’ efforts in the fight against EVD in the country, UNHRD boosted WFP and WHO’s regional response plan in neighbouring Uganda by managing 25 consignments (equalling 147 MT) of stocks and deploying four staff members to Kampala to provide logistics support.

			Since the establishment of UNHRD in 2000, Italy has been providing the premises of the Brindisi hub, funding its expansion and covering all running costs. Italy is not only a longstanding donor, but also a key partner since the Italian Cooperation relies on UNHRD’s services for stock prepositioning and emergency operations. Confirming this longstanding partnership, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (MAECI), H.E. Luigi Di Maio, visited UNHRD’s original facilities in Brindisi in December, accompanying the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, in his first official visit to Italy. In February, UNHRD and the WFP Director of Supply Chain, Jakob Kern, also welcomed the visit of Vice Minister of MAECI, Ms. Emanuela Del Re. In April, the Italian Cooperation donated 40 MT of medicines, shelter and WASH items to Iran valued at USD 321,000 to assist at least 11,000 people affected by the flash flooding.

			Irish Aid has had an operational partnership with UNHRD since 2006, and is a key donor that provides annual and strategic funding to support UNHRD’s development and sustainability. Over the years, Irish Aid has also deployed six staff to UNHRD Accra working on the hub optimization and green technology projects – more information on the latest standby-partner’s mission is available in the Partnership section (hyperlink). In the response to Ethiopia, Irish Aid donated 51 MT of relief items to NGO partner Concern, including 5,475 blankets, 1,100 jerry cans, 6,100 mosquito nets, 2,800 tarpaulins, 2,000 hygiene kits, 3,153 kitchen sets and shelter toolkits.
