		<!-- Foreword -->
		<section class="foreword" id="foreword">
	<div class="content">
	  <h1>Foreword</h1>
	  <p class="lead">The novel coronavirus outbreak, which began in December of 2019, quickly expanded around the globe in early 2020 and, on 11 March, COVID-19 was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a pandemic. 
		
		  </p>
		  <p class="lead">
			The biggest global crisis since World War II, the COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly changed our operational environment and personal lives, pushing us beyond what anyone could have imagined. During this unprecedented emergency, UNHRD tripled its response efforts over the span of a year, supporting the global health and humanitarian response to COVID-19 and existing humanitarian responses around the world. 
			  </p>
		  <div class="grid grid-2">

		  <div>
			<p>
				This report highlights the three operational streams UNHRD was engaged in throughout 2020. In addition to providing core services for sudden-onset emergencies and protracted and complex crises, UNHRD supported partners in their response efforts amidst the pandemic and contributed to WFP’s comprehensive platform of free-to-user cargo transport services established for the COVID-19 global response.
			<p>	This platform for the humanitarian community was built on the existing UNHRD Network, where each hub was already a crucial element of the response effort in respective regions and with Brindisi serving as a global support. UNHRD hubs also provided supplementary support including procurement, transport, handling, customs clearance, and customer service were also used as delivery routes to move crucial items to the final countries of destination.      

			<p> Behind these efforts, there is a unique team of dedicated staff who once again confirmed their commitment to serve the humanitarian community and adapt to new demands. The entire UNHRD team went above and beyond the call of duty to better support partners as new and challenging needs arose during the past year, and five of them share their stories about how COVID-19 has impacted their lives in the body of this Year in Review. 
			</p>

			<p> While 2020 was dominated by COVID-19, it also marked important occasions. On June 20, 2000 an Ilyushin 76 took off from Brindisi with 36 mt of emergency aid and a mobile hospital destined for Asmara on behalf of the Italian Cooperation, to assist Eritreans caught in the border war with Ethiopia. 
			</p>

		</div>
  
		  <div>
			<P>
				That was the very first humanitarian flight managed by UNHRD which had become fully operational at the beginning of that month. Twenty years later, as travel and physical distancing restrictions made it impossible to hold official celebrations, we shared through our digital channels the stories of the pioneering staff and celebrated the forward-looking idea behind the establishment of UNHRD and its growth into a crucial resource for the humanitarian community.
			</p>
	
			<p>
				As part of WFP Supply Chain, UNHRD was also honored to celebrate the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to our organization for its efforts to combat hunger, its contribution to bettering conditions for peace in conflict-affected areas and for acting as a driving force in efforts to prevent the use of hunger as a weapon of war.  
			</p>

			<p>
				What we are now, and what we have achieved over the past 20 years would not have been possible without the generous engagement of our donors. That vision turned into a global model for emergency preparedness and response, a model which was further replicated by WFP to support the global COVID-19 response. UNHRD has never lived on past glories and has continuously grown from and adapted to changing operational environments. Now more than ever, as the world has irreversibly changed, we are committed to continue strengthening our mechanism, augmenting its agility and flexibility, and establishing new partnerships to develop innovative, sustainable solutions to respond to emergencies. The support of our donors remains essential in this venture, and we are thankful that we can continue to count on these important relationships.

		The COVID-19 outbreak, which began in December 2019, rapidly spread around the world, leading to widespread movement restrictions as governments scrambled to protect their citizens and disrupting supply chains, impacting both existing humanitarian operations and the global response to the pandemic.   
	  </p>

	<div class="content">

	  <p>
		In order to support the health and humanitarian response, WFP stepped up to offer its logistics expertise and infrastructure to establish a comprehensive platform of services to move cargo around the globe. Through the Global Humanitarian Response Plan, WFP provided these transport services at no cost to the humanitarian community.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
		UNHRD was the foundation of this platform of services. WFP built on this existing network, scaling up the already crucial support UNHRD was playing in the early stages of the response, and augmented its capacity by establishing global humanitarian hubs in an additional three strategic locations in Guangzhou, China, Johannesburg in South Africa and Liege, Belgium.   
	  </p>
	  <p>
		UNHRD hubs were used to move crucial items to the final country of destination, and provided additional support to WFP’s response including procurement, transport, handling, customs clearance, and customer service.

		On 4 August 2020, a massive explosion at the Port of Beirut, Lebanon devastated part of the city causing over 200 deaths, 6,500 injuries and leaving an estimated 300,000 people homeless.  
	  </p>

	<div class="content">

	  <p>
		Within 24 hours, upon request of the Italian Cooperation, the team at UNHRD Brindisi prepared 8.5 mt of emergency health  supplies and trauma and surgical kits for urgent dispatch to Beirut, with items arriving within 48 hours of the blast.   
	  </p>

	  <p>
		In the following three days, the Brindisi hub managed three air rotations to deliver 18 mobile storage units (MSU)     along with generators and support tools as part of WFP’s  logistics support to the Government of Lebanon.    
	  </p>

	  <p>
		In the three months following the explosion, the Network managed a total of 13 shipments to Lebanon on behalf of six partners, delivering a total of 113 mt of relief items for the Italian Cooperation, the Australian Government , Cascos Blancos and the World Health Organization, as well as tools and equipment for the United Nations Development Programme.

	  <p class="lead">“Italy is very proud to host the United Nations Humanitarian Response Depot (UNHRD) in Brindisi and to be supporting the whole UNHRD network as the main donor country. In the current global scenario, characterized by sudden and unpredictable man-made and natural disasters, humanitarian needs on the rise, as well as growing obstacles in the delivery of aid, the UNHRD network represents, more than ever, a key tool in the hands of the humanitarian international community to respond rapidly and efficiently to emergencies.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
		In 2020 we celebrated the 20th anniversary of the UNHRD project, a long and exciting journey since the establishment of the first UNHRD hub in Brindisi. Since then, UNHRD has constantly expanded, counting today more than 90 partners. The UNHRD hub in Brindisi plays nowadays a vital role in international humanitarian logistics, with over 130 shipments carried out in 2020. Thanks to UNHRD Brindisi services, the Italian Cooperation is able to swiftly deliver relief and health items in all areas in the world. 
Unfortunately, demanding challenges, such as health crises, conflicts and natural disasters continue to affect the humanitarian landscape. In this context, as part of Italy’s broader engagement to strengthen its long-standing partnership with the United Nations system, the Italian Cooperation is committed to further supporting UNHRD Brindisi and the whole network and to enhance its global preparedness and response capacity.”

	  <p class="lead">
	  The geographical location and climatic conditions of Panama places us as one of the countries with the best connections in the American continent, since it allows us to bridge the North with the South.  Thus, Panama is the point where the main world traffic routes cross, positioning ourselves as one of the most important logistics centers in the Western Hemisphere for stockpiling and distributing cargo at the global level. 
	  We consider the establishment in Panama of the United Nations Humanitarian Response Depot (UNHRD), one of the main international partners of the Regional Logistics Centre for Humanitarian Assistance (CLRAH), as a great advance in the country's development and well-being for the American region. In fact, from this hub multiple operations are carried out to respond to emergencies, such as in the delivery of tons of items to minimize the damage cause by COVID-19.   
	  </p>
	  <p>
		We have the privilege of hosting one of the six hub strategically located around the world in order to respond to emergencies in less than five hours, exemplified by the response to the COVID-19 pandemic where more than 818 metric tons of supplies have been moved to various parts of the region, including tents, prefabricated offices, vehicles, water purifiers and medicine.  
	  </p>

	  <p>
		Panama believes that investing in humanitarian action is a wise choice that offers us tangible and measurable results and has a proven track record of success. By supporting humanitarian response plans, we ensure that our resources are channeled to the right actors with the presence and capacity to help people in need.   
	  </p>

	  <p>
		Working together as a team is vital also since it is very difficult to predict where the next crisis will arise.   
	  </p>

	  <p>
		The benefits accrued by Panama and the region due to the presence of the UN Humanitarian Response Depot Network, in particular for the CLRAH, have been incalculable, for which we reiterate the intention of the Panamanian State to continue collaborating with WFP-UNHRD.

		The UNHRD Network is one of the pillars of the humanitarian response coordination around the world. From its creation 20 years ago to the current Covid-19 crisis, the UNHRD Network has proven to be an increasingly efficient logistics leader in any emergency. 
		Throughout these 20 years, Spain has been a solid partner of WFP. Among other contributions, Spain hosts the WFP’s logistic base in Las Palmas and supports UNHRD through contributions to the humanitarian platform in Panama and through the chairmanship of the Group of Friends of the UNHRD Network.   
	  </p>
	  <p>
		There are still many challenges along the way. We know we can improve coordination in the Humanitarian Response by ensuring greater predictability, accountability and partnership. This is the spirit of the Agenda 2030. It requires innovation and the establishment of transformative partnerships, including with the private sector and universities, that may strengthen the UNHRD Network’s capacity to fulfill its goals and, ultimately, to improve the impact of the humanitarian assistance on the beneficiaries.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		The Group of Friends has become a useful supporter of the Network by providing space for dialogue and raising awareness about the important role of the UNHRD. We will continue closely cooperating with the UNHRD in this endeavor.

We are proud not for simply hosting UNHRD, but also to have established a strong partnership that allowed the development of relevant projects such as the Humanitarian Logistics Databank which go beyond the “technical agreement”.  </p>

		From my position as CEO of IHC, I'm very proud of our partnership with UNHRD. I'm also very proud as former UNHRD to celebrate the 20th anniversary of UNHRD and  my wish is to see the humanitarian community reinforcing more and more the approach of “Working all together and delivering as One”, as this is the expectation in the future from my perspective as “donor” of UNHRD.

		In addition to this networking ability, UNHRD network enables middle size NGO to access proper international storage, at no cost to strengthen their ability to be first line responder as any other agency, even if capacity to invest are not has important as for bigger agencies. Finally, UNHRD is a great tool in protracted crisis response, as it ensures directly available stocks, from UNHRD partners, to allow faster international procurement through both loan & borrow and “white stock” from suppliers, stockpiled at UNHRD.

			At this moment in time, there are almost 13,000 family tents stocked in UNHRD warehouses across the Network. They are one of the most common relief items used by UNHRD partners to assist populations in conflict, refugees and post-disaster crises.
		  </p>

	  <p>
		With babies and newborns among the most vulnerable in these crises, and with limited relief items specifically designed for their wellbeing, the UNHRD Lab, with its suppliers, developed the “Cradle Tent” which, once the geodesic tent is taken and installed, allows for the wooden crate to be modified into a crib with rockers, a baby mattress and sheets. This newly developed relief item also includes a blanket, a pillow with accompanying cover, a changing mat and a mosquito net. There are also complementary pieces such as a teddy bear, produced with excess materials from the production of blankets, a blackboard on the internal side of the crate’s lid, with white chalk and an eraser, and a picture book. 
	  </p>
	  <p> “Cradle Tent” is a great example of UNHRD Lab’s cross-sectoral efforts in waste reduction, and using repackaging to create a circular economy.

				2020 was the most challenging period since I joined UNHRD. While we were working hard to support the humanitarian community during the pandemic, we were ourselves in the midst of the same emergency. From one moment to the next we began working from home, and the workload increased hugely. It took some time to adapt and adjust to the new work dynamic, including balancing a professional and private life now both happening in the same place, my home.

				The Las Palmas hub is located within the port area, so there were no restrictions to the operations during the lockdown period as port operations were considered essential. The adaptation to the prevention measures was easy as our suppliers were well aware of the risks of an outbreak and there was close cooperation to avoid contagion and, fortunately, we have not suffered any cases of COVID-19 among WFP staff or the employees of our contractors. 

From my personal point of view, similar to many other WFP colleagues I have been in contact with, it was not easy to deal with lockdown living alone but the hardest part was not to be able to see my family for six months. Also, it was sad not to be able to be close to the friends that lost relatives as the restrictions banned wakes and funerals.
