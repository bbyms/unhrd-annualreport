          2018 in review
        </h1>
        <p>With new crises occurring and protracted crises increasing, 2018 was another challenging year for the
          humanitarian community. Unfortunately, this trend has become somewhat of a default setting over the past few
          years and we as humanitarians have had to adjust our own ways of working to ensure aid is delivered and
          national capacities to cope are strengthened. </p>

        <h1>Foreword</h1>
        <p class="lead">In June UNHRD celebrated the 18th anniversary of its founding, marking the establishment of the
          first hub in Brindisi in 2000. In many countries around the world, turning 18 signifies a transition into
          adulthood; now more than ever we, as a Network, must hold ourselves accountable as a critical tool for
          emergency preparedness and response, and work even harder for our humanitarian partners so they can rely on us
          to meet more demanding challenges in ever more complex environments.</p>
          <div class="grid grid-2">

            <div>
              <p>
                This Year in Review provides an overview that demonstrates the support UNHRD provided to its partners
                responding to crises all over the world. The figures in this report were collated using newly developed
                automated reporting tools, which will soon be available to partners as part of our efforts to expand our
                digital services (we look forward to giving our partners more control of their stocks, analytics and activity
                reports in 2019 through a newly revamped website and online partner portal).
              </p>
      
              <p>
                What cannot be so directly quantified is the work going on behind the scenes that makes every operation
                possible. From the suppliers to the final destinations, UNHRD performs a number of important back-office
                functions to deliver relief items and logistics equipment to those in the field. Therefore, we are dedicating
                part of this report to recognize the work of staff who provide fundamental support in procurement, finance,
                human resources and admin to keep the UNHRD mechanism running smoothly and efficiently.
              </p>

              <p>
                These staff are crucial when deploying the UNHRD Rapid Response Team and other staff on temporary field
                assignments to provide technical support to our colleagues in the field. 
              </p>
            </div>
    
            <div>
              <p>
                  Throughout 2018, UNHRD staff were
                  deployed to 15 countries; this report will highlight the experiences of colleagues who worked in the
                  Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Chad and Uganda, as well as capacity building activities in Kuala
                  Lumpur. 
                Additionally, UNHRD organized, participated in or hosted a number of trainings and simulations to
                build the logistics and response capacities of its partners.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                As we try to keep up with new challenges and contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals, UNHRD continues
                to develop its own innovation LAB. Hosted in the Brindisi hub, the LAB is a research and development unit that
                engages in efforts to improve logistics support equipment and packaging solutions. Partnering with
                humanitarian organizations, academia, private sector actors and other stakeholders, the LAB is committed to
                help the humanitarian community find new ways to reduce the environmental impact of operations, including by
                integrating green technologies, reducing waste, and reusing and upcycling packaging materials.
              </p>

              <p>
                Once again, we would like to sincerely thank our donors for their generous support, and our partners and
                colleagues for their great teamwork. Your efforts and collaboration are what allow UNHRD to assist our 88
                humanitarian partners provide lifesaving support to those in need.
              </p>

          In 2018, the Yemen crisis hit the headlines as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Since
          March 2015, the conflict has exacerbated the already precarious situation in Yemen – the poorest country in
          the Arab world.

      <div class="content">

        <p>Against this backdrop, Yemen also faced the worst cholera outbreak of 2017 with more than one million suspected cases reported by the end of December and a new acceleration in
          September 2018. UNHRD has supported partner organizations in their logistics and relief efforts especially by
          dispatching prefabricated mobile tents to increase the warehousing capacity for the humanitarian community
          operating in the country.

          <h2>INFLATABLE REFRIGERATED TENT</h2>
          <p>
            Sometimes, new solutions are already available on the market but may not be specifically developed for humanitarian purposes. This is the case, for example, of inflatable refrigerated tents where the UNHRD LAB has suggested the implementation of solar panels and is testing its suitability to fields settings. This activity builds on one of the very first projects of the UNHRD Lab, the Temperature Controlled Unit (TCU), and is part of a research and development series to keep foods and medicine in the field.

          <h2>REPACKAGING</h2>
          <p>
            Upon realizing that 10% of what is delivered to humanitarian contexts turn into waste, the UNHRD LAB has
            engaged in efforts to improve packaging, including by reusing it or giving it a second life. New solutions
            under development would benefit the beneficiaries, who would receive more efficient relief items, and the
            environment, especially in terms of what is left behind from humanitarian operations.

          <h2>SOLAR KITCHEN SET</h2>
          <p>
            In poor or disaster areas, energy sources can be costly, scarce and unreliable and also
            very harmful to the environment. Wood fuel in most cases requires a cumbersome collecting process. As the
            kitchen set is one of the most delivered relief items, the UNHRD LAB is redesigning its packaging to be
            easily turned into a solar cooker. This solution is easy-to-set-up as it requires no more than three steps
            to set up the solar cooker in less than a minute. It is also environment-friendly as it reduces waste and
            consumption and the effects of fossil fuels.

          <h2>CRADLE TENT</h2>
          <p>
            Family tents are shipped in large wooden crates that most of the time become waste or wood fuel, both having
            an environmental impact. As these tents are often used by families with small children, but they don’t come
            with accessories for babies, the UNHRD LAB has redesigned the crate
            to be used as a cradle for small children from 0 to 4 months. With a key support from the suppliers, who
            would have to modify the proportion of the crate and include some tools, this project would add a new and
            innovative relief item to UNHRD’s catalogue, in addition to the standard family tent.

              excellence for trainings, offering a unique set for scenario-based simulations and exercises to prepare

        <h1>Behind the scenes</h1>
        <p>Shipments, tonnages, cubic metres, countries and partners served, values of goods dispatched, services provided, deployments to the field - behind these figures are UNHRD logisticians, storekeepers, drivers, and the Rapid Response Team members. Based out of Brindisi, Italy, the UNHRD Support Office works on the administration, finance, human resources, and procurement activities that keep the operations moving. The Support Office launches bids, establishes Long Term Agreements, and procures items to replenish the warehouses throughout the network; they hire new staff and organise deployments; they administer contributions, release and monitor funds, and process invoices; these are a few examples of what they do, on a daily basis, behind the scenes. The Support Office is vital in maintaining the efficiency and effectiveness of UNHRD operations.</p>

            <p>Some of the team-members have been working with UNHRD for many years, some even since its creation in 2000. They know its mechanisms inside-out and can provide operational support to their colleagues across the Network. In 2018, the Support Office also provided assistance to WFP Supply Chain on projects such as the DRC Ebola Crisis response, providing back office support to the staff and operations on the ground.</p>
