          2018 in review 
        </h1>
        <p>2018 was another challenging year for the humanitarian community.
          <br /> As new crises occur now and then, some existing ones are protracting, some others are becoming
          complex, this has unfortunately become a default statement over the past decade. </p>

        <h1>Foreword</h1>
        <p class="lead">In June we marked the 18th birthday of UNHRD, celebrating the establishment in 2000 of our
          first hub in Brindisi. In many countries of the world turning 18 means becoming adult, now more than ever we
          have to confirm that we have grown as a vital tool for emergency preparedness and response, be accountable
          for our job and reinforce that humanitarian partners can rely on us to meet more, multiple and demanding
          challenges. </p>
        <p>
          This Year in Review provides fact and figures that clearly quantify the support we provided to our partners
          to respond to crisis all over the world. It didn’t take much to gather these figures as we are now testing
          and starting using automated reporting tools, which we will make soon available to our partners as part of
          our efforts to also expand our digital services. Through our revamped website and new platform, we aim at
          allowing organizations working with us have full control of their stocks analytics and activities reports.
        </p>

        <p>
          What cannot be automatically and directly quantified is the work behind the scenes that makes every operation
          possible. From the suppliers to the final destinations, there a number of important back-office functions to
          deliver relief items and logistics equipment. We are dedicating some space in this report to recognize the
          work of staff who provide fundamental support in procurement, finance, human resources and admin making the
          UNHRD mechanism up and running, smoothly and efficiently.
        </p>

        <p>
          Their job is also crucial to deploy the UNHRD Rapid Response Team or other staff for temporary duty
          assignments to operations. During 2018, we put even more efforts to provide technical support to our
          colleagues in the field. Similarly, we have organized, participated to or hosted trainings and simulations to
          build logistics and response capacities of our partners. Out of the many of us who travelled to 5 countries,
          this brief recalls the experience of colleagues who were deployed to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, XX
          and XX, and reports of capacity building activities in Kuala Lumpur.
        </p>

        <p>
          As we try to keep up with new challenges and contribute more and more to the Sustainable Development Goals,
          since a few years UNHRD has its own innovation Lab. Hosted in our Brindisi hub, it is a research and
          development unit that engages in efforts to improve logistics support equipment and packaging solutions.
          Partnering with humanitarian organizations, academia, private sectors and other stakeholders we are committed
          to help the humanitarian community find new ways to reduce the environmental impact of operations including
          by integrating green technologies, reducing waste and reusing materials. We usually say, and we said to many
          curious colleagues during the last Global Partners Meeting: hard to understand what it is about, until you
          see it yourself! For 2019 and beyond – in addition to perform and be accountable for our core business – we
          are committed to produce a regular newsletter on the Lab’s projects and on other major updates.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once again, and this is not a default statement, we would like to thank our donors for their generous support
          and our partners and colleagues for their teamwork. This is what we call ‘working together’, what allow us to
          reach people in need and save lives.
        </p>

          In 2018, the Yemen crisis has hit the headlines as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Since
          March 2015, the conflict has exacerbated the already precarious situation in Yemen – the poorest country in

          September 2018. UNHRD has supported partner organizations in their logistics and relief efforts especially by
          dispatching prefabricated mobile tents to increase the warehousing capacity for the humanitarian community
          operating in the country.

          The Italian Cooperation established an air bridge to Niger with 7 deliveries between April and December to
          support the health system in the country. A total of 60 metric tons of medicines, health devices and water
          purification units were airlifted to contribute to the Government’s response to a broad health emergency
          complicated by meningitis and cholera outbreaks. Combined with deliveries for WHO, medical kits and devices
          make up the 35,5 % of the 259 MT of cargo delivered to Niger while emergency shelter items represent 47.6%.

          recognize the need to invest in emergency preparedness and response to ensure a sustainable UNHRD Network.
          Taking over the chairmanship, Ambassador Jesús Manuel García Aldaz, Permanent Representative of Spain to the
          UN in Rome, emphasized that “the spirit of the Agenda 2030 requires innovation and the establishment of

          On 19 November, Panama’s new Regional Logistics Center for Humanitarian Assistance was officially inaugurated
          by President Juan Carlos Varela. Consisting of three warehouses for a total storage capacity of 12.000 square
          meters and cold rooms, the Humanitarian Hub is the new home to UNHRD, the International Federation of Red
          Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and the National Civil Protection System (SINAPROC).

        <p>
          "I saw the blueprints for this project, seeing those turn into reality and being part of this is exciting",
          UNHRD Network Coordinator Bekim Mahmuti recalled at the inauguration of humanitarian hub. “It has now been 12
          years since UNHRD first opened its hub in Panama. Since that time we have responded to emergencies across the
          Latin American region. This year alone, we have had shipments go to Perú, Ecuador, Cuba, Dominica, Antigua and
          Barbuda, Guatemala and Venezuela, where we are supporting the ongoing operations. This has only been made
          possible thanks to Panama”, Mahmuti emphasized.
        </p>
        <p>Panama has hosted a UNHRD hub since 2007 and became a UNHRD partner in 2016. This is yet another great
          example of a collaboration that goes far beyond the traditional donor/recipient relationship and has already
          resulted in great steps forward for the Network.</p>

            In poor or disaster areas, energy sources can be costly, scarce and unreliable and anyway

            easily turned into a solar cooker. This solution is easy-to-set-up as it requires no more than three steps
            to set up the solar cooker in less than a minute. It is also environment-friendly as it reduces waste and

            these are used as wood fuel. As these tents are often used by family

            with small children, but they don’t come with accessories for babies, the UNHRD Lab is redesigned the crate
            to use it as a cradle from small children from 0 to 4 months. With a key support from the suppliers, who
            would have to modify the proportion of the crate and include some tools, this project would add a new and
            innovative relief item to UNHRD’s catalogue, in addition to the standard family tent.
