          UNHRD's 2018 in review <br/>
        </h1>
        <p>2018 was another challenging year for the humanitarian community. 
          <br /> As new crises occur now and then, some existing ones are protracting, some others are becoming complex, this has unfortunately become a default statement over the past decade.  </p>

        <h1>Foreword</h1>
        <p class="lead">In June we marked the 18th birthday of UNHRD, celebrating the establishment in 2000 of our first hub in Brindisi. In many countries of the world turning 18 means becoming adult, now more than ever we have to confirm that we have grown as a vital tool for emergency preparedness and response, be accountable for our job and reinforce that humanitarian partners can rely on us to meet more, multiple and demanding challenges. </p>
        <p>
            This Year in Review provides fact and figures that clearly quantify the support we provided to our partners to respond to crisis all over the world. It didn’t take much to gather these figures as we are now testing and starting using automated reporting tools, which we will make soon available to our partners as part of our efforts to also expand our digital services. Through our revamped website and new platform, we aim at allowing organizations working with us have full control of their stocks analytics and activities reports. 
        </p>

        <p>
            What cannot be automatically and directly quantified is the work behind the scenes that makes every operation possible. From the suppliers to the final destinations, there a number of important back-office functions to deliver relief items and logistics equipment. We are dedicating some space in this report to recognize the work of staff who provide fundamental support in procurement, finance, human resources and admin making the UNHRD mechanism up and running, smoothly and efficiently.     
        </p>

        <p>
            Their job is also crucial to deploy the UNHRD Rapid Response Team or other staff for temporary duty assignments to operations. During 2018, we put even more efforts to provide technical support to our colleagues in the field. Similarly, we have organized, participated to or hosted trainings and simulations to build logistics and response capacities of our partners. Out of the many of us who travelled to XX countries, this brief recalls the experience of colleagues who were deployed to XX, XX and XX, and reports of capacity building activities in XX, XX and XX. 
        </p>

        <p>
            As we try to keep up with new challenges and contribute more and more to the Sustainable Development Goals, since a few years UNHRD has its own innovation Lab. Hosted in our Brindisi hub, it is a research and development unit that engages in efforts to improve logistics support equipment and packaging solutions. Partnering with humanitarian organizations, academia, private sectors and other stakeholders we are committed to help the humanitarian community find new ways to reduce the environmental impact of operations including by integrating green technologies, reducing waste and reusing materials.  We usually say, and we said to many curious colleagues during the last Global Partners Meeting: hard to understand what it is about, until you see it yourself! For 2019 and beyond – in addition to perform and be accountable for our core business – we are committed to produce a regular newsletter on the Lab’s projects and on other major updates.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once again, and this is not a default statement, we would like to thank our donors for their generous support and our partners and colleagues for their teamwork. This is what we call ‘working together’, what allow us to reach people in need and save lives.

        <h1>Yemen</h1>

        <p class="lead">In 2018, the Yemen crisis has hit the headlines as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Since March 2015, the conflict has exacerbated the already precarious situation in Yemen – the poorest country in the Arab world since before the war. Against this backdrop, Yemen also faced the worst cholera outbreak in 2017 with more than one million suspected cases reported by the end of December and a new acceleration in September 2018. UNHRD has supported partner organizations in their logistics and relief efforts especially by dispatching prefabricated mobile tents to increase the warehousing capacity for the humanitarian community operating in the country.

          <p class="lead">Described as the fastest growing and one of the largest refugee crisis in the world, the Rohingya emergency in Bangladesh has entered its second year in August 2018. More than 900,000 refugees live in the area of Cox’s Bazaar, with Kutupalong-Balukhali camp as the largest and most densely populated refugee camp in the world. The vast majority of them rely on humanitarian assistance to survive. Throughout the year, one of the main challenges has been the safety of the camps during the Monsoon season. Out of 449 tons of equipment and aid delivered by UNHRD to Bangladesh, 53.65 % or 241 tons consisted of emergency shelter.
