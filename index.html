          UNHRD's 2018 in review <br />
        </h1>
        <p>2018 was another challenging year for the humanitarian community.
          <br /> As new crises occur now and then, some existing ones are protracting, some others are becoming
          complex, this has unfortunately become a default statement over the past decade. </p>
      </div>

    <section class="intro">
      <div class="content">
        <h1>Foreword</h1>
        <p class="lead">In June we marked the 18th birthday of UNHRD, celebrating the establishment in 2000 of our
          first hub in Brindisi. In many countries of the world turning 18 means becoming adult, now more than ever we
          have to confirm that we have grown as a vital tool for emergency preparedness and response, be accountable
          for our job and reinforce that humanitarian partners can rely on us to meet more, multiple and demanding
          challenges. </p>
        <p>
          This Year in Review provides fact and figures that clearly quantify the support we provided to our partners
          to respond to crisis all over the world. It didn’t take much to gather these figures as we are now testing
          and starting using automated reporting tools, which we will make soon available to our partners as part of
          our efforts to also expand our digital services. Through our revamped website and new platform, we aim at
          allowing organizations working with us have full control of their stocks analytics and activities reports.
        </p>

        <p>
          What cannot be automatically and directly quantified is the work behind the scenes that makes every operation
          possible. From the suppliers to the final destinations, there a number of important back-office functions to
          deliver relief items and logistics equipment. We are dedicating some space in this report to recognize the
          work of staff who provide fundamental support in procurement, finance, human resources and admin making the
          UNHRD mechanism up and running, smoothly and efficiently.
        </p>

        <p>
          Their job is also crucial to deploy the UNHRD Rapid Response Team or other staff for temporary duty
          assignments to operations. During 2018, we put even more efforts to provide technical support to our
          colleagues in the field. Similarly, we have organized, participated to or hosted trainings and simulations to
          build logistics and response capacities of our partners. Out of the many of us who travelled to XX countries,
          this brief recalls the experience of colleagues who were deployed to XX, XX and XX, and reports of capacity
          building activities in XX, XX and XX.
        </p>

        <p>
          As we try to keep up with new challenges and contribute more and more to the Sustainable Development Goals,
          since a few years UNHRD has its own innovation Lab. Hosted in our Brindisi hub, it is a research and
          development unit that engages in efforts to improve logistics support equipment and packaging solutions.
          Partnering with humanitarian organizations, academia, private sectors and other stakeholders we are committed
          to help the humanitarian community find new ways to reduce the environmental impact of operations including
          by integrating green technologies, reducing waste and reusing materials. We usually say, and we said to many
          curious colleagues during the last Global Partners Meeting: hard to understand what it is about, until you
          see it yourself! For 2019 and beyond – in addition to perform and be accountable for our core business – we
          are committed to produce a regular newsletter on the Lab’s projects and on other major updates.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once again, and this is not a default statement, we would like to thank our donors for their generous support
          and our partners and colleagues for their teamwork. This is what we call ‘working together’, what allow us to
          reach people in need and save lives.

        <h1>Yemen</h1>

        <p class="lead">In 2018, the Yemen crisis has hit the headlines as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Since
          March 2015, the conflict has exacerbated the already precarious situation in Yemen – the poorest country in
          the Arab world since before the war. Against this backdrop, Yemen also faced the worst cholera outbreak in
          2017 with more than one million suspected cases reported by the end of December and a new acceleration in
          September 2018. UNHRD has supported partner organizations in their logistics and relief efforts especially by
          dispatching prefabricated mobile tents to increase the warehousing capacity for the humanitarian community
          operating in the country.

        <p class="lead">Described as the fastest growing and one of the largest refugee crisis in the world, the
          Rohingya emergency in Bangladesh has entered its second year in August 2018. More than 900,000 refugees live
          in the area of Cox’s Bazaar, with Kutupalong-Balukhali camp as the largest and most densely populated refugee
          camp in the world. The vast majority of them rely on humanitarian assistance to survive. Throughout the year,
          one of the main challenges has been the safety of the camps during the Monsoon season. Out of 449 tons of
          equipment and aid delivered by UNHRD to Bangladesh, 53.65 % or 241 tons consisted of emergency shelter.

        <p class="lead">With 13.1 million people in dire need of assistance, the Democratic Republic of the Congo
          continues to witness one of the most multiform and long-standing humanitarian crisis. The situation has
          further deteriorated with an outbreak of cholera in the North Kivu, officially declared in August 2018. This
          can be described as the most complex Ebola outbreak response in history, with the virus found in an area
          where there is a violent conflict and due to record numbers of refugees and internally displaced people.
          UNHRD has supported aid organizations operating in such exceptionally complex and challenging environment to
          prevent and control the spread of the disease.

        <p class="lead">On 28 September a number of strong earthquakes hit Central Sulawesi in Indonesia with a 7.4
          magnitude shock triggering a tsunami that struck Palu City. The response has been led by the Government of
          Indonesia, through the National Disaster Management Authority (BNPB), in collaboration with the ASEAN
          Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management (AHA Centre). They welcomed offers of
          international assistance as of 1 October to meet specific humanitarian needs. Since then, UNHRD has supported
          partners delivering much needed emergency shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) items and logistics
          equipment.
        </p>

        <p>
          A devastating 7.5 magnitude earthquake followed by a series of severe aftershocks caused widespread damages
          in Papua New Guinea leaving many villages isolated and more than 270.000 people in need of humanitarian
          assistance.
        </p>

        <p>
          UNHRD airlifted 80 tons of high-energy biscuits for WFP to assist 60.000 people affected by the earthquake
          and three prefabricated storage units to set up a staging area. The airlift was facilitated by the
          International Humanitarian City (IHC) through a plane provided by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al
          Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai.

          refugees as well as Ugandans affected by recurring climate shocks with food assistance, WFP provides other
          humanitarian agencies with supply chain services and expertise to support their operations in country and in
          the region.

          In March, a B747 carried 30 prefabricated storage tents, 30 generators and 5 scales to Entebbe for WFP’s

          The Italian Cooperation established an air bridge to Niger with 7 deliveries between April and December to
          support the health system in the country. A total of 60 metric tons of medicines, health devices and water
          purification units were airlifted to contribute to the Government’s response to a broad health emergency
          complicated by meningitis and cholera outbreaks. Combined with deliveries for WHO, medical kits and devices
          make up the 35,5 % of the 259 MT of cargo delivered to Niger while emergency shelter items represent 47.6 %
