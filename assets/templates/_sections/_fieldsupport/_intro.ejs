			In 2019, the UNHRD Field Team was deployed at two sudden-onset emergencies: five field experts travelled to Mozambique in March and helped to kick-start the logistics response to Cyclone Idai; and three reached the Bahamas following Hurricane Dorian and worked on the ground for one month.

			In addition, UNHRD staff also travelled to Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Jordan, Kenya, Panama, Sudan and Uganda to support in-country operations.
