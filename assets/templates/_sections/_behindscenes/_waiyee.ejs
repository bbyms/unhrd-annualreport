			<q>COVID-19 prompted us to reinvent ourselves. We were in the middle of moving and operating from our new hub facilities in Panama when the pandemic struck. Because of increasing needs, we continued to also run the old hangar and dedicated it to receiving stock for the COVID-19 response. In the meanwhile, we handled meetings, airport operations, cargo preparation and dispatches, in addition to establishing new cargo handling and monitoring systems. It was a challenge, but with the support of the team we managed it. There is nothing more rewarding than knowing that you gave 100 percent plus a couple of cents for an operation.
