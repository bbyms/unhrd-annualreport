        <p>With new crises occurring and protracted crises increasing, 2018 was another challenging year for the
          humanitarian community. Unfortunately, this trend has become somewhat of a default setting over the past few
          years and we as humanitarians have had to adjust our own ways of working to ensure aid is delivered and
		  national capacities to cope are strengthened. </p>
		  <p>
			Time is of the essence in achieving efficient and successful emergency responses within the health supply chain. The biggest challenge of Nesrinâ€™s job is to deliver medical supplies on time to remote locations, where infrastructure damage has occurred, or standard transport means are unavailable due to geographical or security issues.

				As a medical caregiver, I have a passion to help people in need. Working in the humanitarian sector has fulfilled me and provides satisfaction each day through adding value to people who are most in need of help, either in the context of pandemic emergencies and natural or manmade disasters.
