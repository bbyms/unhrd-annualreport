		In a ceremony on 18 June at the annual session of the Executive Board of the World Food Programme, the Italian
		Government handed over the chairmanship of the ‘Group of Friends of UNHRD’ to the Spanish Government. Also
		promoted by the Government of Panama, the event was the opportunity to celebrate the 18th anniversary of
		UNHRD, which was first established in Brindisi, Italy in June 2000.

		Launched in 2015 by the Italian Government, the Group of Friends of UNHRD brings together donors, partners and
		other actors who aim to raise awareness on the role of UNHRD in the global humanitarian architecture and who
		recognize the need to invest in emergency preparedness and response to ensure a sustainable UNHRD Network.
		Taking over the chairmanship, Ambassador Jesús Manuel García Aldaz, Permanent Representative of Spain to the
		UN in Rome, emphasized that “the spirit of the Agenda 2030 requires innovation and the establishment of
		transformative partnerships, including with the private sector and universities.”
